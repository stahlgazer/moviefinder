# Project Title
The Movie Ark

## Description
The Movie Ark generates a list of the most popular new movies for users to see, as well as giving the ability to search for any movie. If the movie you typed in doesn't exist, it will show you similar results in order to help you find what you're looking for. It's never been easier to find out what new movies are worth watching, or to quickly search for anything in mind!
